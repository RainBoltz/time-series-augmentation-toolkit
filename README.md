# time-series-augmentation-toolkit
A simple toolkit that helps researchers or specialists to generate more training dataset by augmentation!

## Requirements
  - numpy>=1.12
    
## Methods
  1. **Window Slicing (WS)**: extracting slices from time series and performing classification at the slice level
  2. **Window Warping (WW)**: warping a randomly selected slice of a time series by speeding it up or down
  3. **Extrapolating (EP)**: extrapolating between samples in feature space
    
## Usage
